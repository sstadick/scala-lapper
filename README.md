# scala-lapper

This is a Scala port of the
[nim-lapper](https://github.com/brentp/nim-lapper). It is also inspired
by the rust port [rust-lapper](https://docs.rs/rust-lapper). 

The eventual goal is to add an Augmented Interval List structure as
well, and then allow for dynamically choosing which to use based on the
input interval profile.
